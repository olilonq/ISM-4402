#Can you sort the dataframe to order it by name, age, and then grade?

import pandas as pd
Location ="datasets/gradedata.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(Location)
df = df.sort_values(by=['fname','age','grade'],ascending=[ True, True, True])
df.head()

#Chose to sort by only first name because it was not specified to use both,
#If i should sort by both fname and lname i'd just add 'lname' to the array 
#between 'fname' and 'age' and add another True value in ascending.
#I can add False values if I want that to be descending
